‚õìÔ∏è Still trying to solve complex problems with one massive prompt?

From Chapter 9 of my book Building Effective LLM-Based applications with C#

Complex chain-of-thought prompts are "chain-of-problems" prompts. The more you ask an LLM to do in a single step, the more likely it is to fail spectacularly somewhere in the middle.

Most developers are still writing prompts like "First research this, then create an outline, then expand each section" and praying the LLM follows their 10-step plan. But here's what the pros know: Breaking complex tasks into focused prompt chains gives you better quality, better testability, and actual control over the workflow.

I learned this building content generation workflow where single prompts would randomly ignore steps or hallucinate research that didn't exist. The breakthrough came when I realized that LLMs excel at solving ONE focused goal with relevant information, not juggling multiple complex operations simultaneously.

The game-changer? Prompt chains let you control WHEN tools get called instead of relying on probability-based detection. You research first, outline second, then generate content‚Äîwith full visibility into each step's success or failure.

Want to know the two prompt chain patterns that turn chaotic AI workflows into reliable production systems?

Read Chapter 9 to discover divide-and-conquer vs refinement patterns‚Äîfrom basic sequential chains to advanced auto-corrective steps and parallelization strategies that actually work in production.

üìñ What you'll master in this chapter:

- Why complex prompts fail and how prompt chains solve the reliability problem
- Divide-and-conquer vs refinement patterns for different use cases
- Step-by-step implementation using Semantic Kernel with real code examples
- Testing strategies for multi-step workflows with external dependencies
- Optimization techniques: auto-correction, parallelization, and intelligent caching
