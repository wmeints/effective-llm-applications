ðŸ§ª Think you can test LLM applications the same way you test regular code?

From Chapter 5 of my book Building Effective LLM-Based applications with C#

Here's the brutal truth: LLMs give you different responses every time you call them. You can't test for specific outputs like traditional software. But here's what most developers miss â€” you CAN test for patterns and properties that should always hold true.

The breakthrough approach? Property-based testing combined with model-based validation. Instead of checking if the LLM outputs exactly "Recipe: Pasta with tomatoes," you test whether the response contains ingredients and instructions. Then you use the LLM itself to evaluate more complex properties like consistency and coherence.

But here's the warning nobody talks about: when you use an LLM to test an LLM, you're not getting real scoresâ€”you're getting tokens in a sequence that happen to look like evaluation metrics. It's weird, but research shows these "fake" scores have remarkable agreement with human experts.

Here's another thing I learned building LLM-based applications. Monitoring is essential, because even with great tests, there's no place like production when it comes to agents and AI autoamted workflows.

Want to know the testing strategies that actually work for non-deterministic AI systems?

Read Chapter 5 to discover the complete testing and monitoring approachâ€”from deterministic pattern checks to model-based evaluation techniques, plus the OpenTelemetry setup that captures real production data for continuous improvement.

ðŸ“– What you'll master in this chapter:

- Property-based testing strategies that work with non-deterministic LLM outputs
- Model-based testing techniques using G-Eval and GPTScore approaches  
- Production monitoring with OpenTelemetry traces, metrics, and logging
- LLMOps dashboard setup in Azure Application Insights
- Safety precautions for collecting telemetry data from LLM interactions
