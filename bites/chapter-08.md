ðŸŽ¯ Tired of writing regex patterns to parse chaotic LLM responses that break half the time?

From Chapter 8 of my book Building Effective LLM-Based applications with C#

Here's a game-changer: You can force LLMs to output perfectly structured JSON that your code can reliably parseâ€”no more "output this in a table" prayers followed by regex nightmares.

Most developers are still stuck asking LLMs to "put the result in a fenced markdown code block" and then crossing their fingers. But here's what they're missing: Modern LLMs support JSON schema-based structured output with 100% accuracy when properly configured. OpenAI uses constrained decoding to overlay grammar rules that only allow valid tokens through the sampling mechanism.

I learned this building code conversion pipelines where LLMs kept giving me helpful explanations instead of actual code. I discovered you can specify response formats using C# types in Semantic Kernel â€” no manual JSON schema writing required.

But here's the advanced technique that separates the pros from beginners: sideband communication. Think v0.dev or bolt.new where you get chat responses AND structured content generation simultaneously. It's not magicâ€”it's strategic tool calling combined with real-time communication channels.

Want to eliminate the parsing chaos that's breaking your LLM workflows?

Read Chapter 8 to discover both structured output techniquesâ€”from constrained decoding for reliable data extraction to sideband communication for interactive applications that feel like magic to your users.

ðŸ“– What you'll master in this chapter:

- JSON schema-based output formatting with 100% structural accuracy
- Constrained decoding vs instruction-based generation (and why it matters)
- Tool calling techniques for LLMs that don't support structured output
- Sideband communication patterns using SignalR for real-time updates
- Advanced chat + structured content scenarios like code generation interfaces
