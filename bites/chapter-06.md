ðŸ”§ What if your agent could actually DO things instead of just talk about them?

From Chapter 6 of my book Building Effective LLM-Based applications with C#

Here's the game-changer: LLMs can't access the internet, generate images, or interact with your business dataâ€”but they can call tools that do all of these things through Semantic Kernel functions.

When you ask an application like ChatGPT to search the web or generate an image, you're not seeing LLM magic. You're witnessing tool calling in action. The LLM detects what tool to use from your prompt, extracts the necessary data, and gives your application the information it needs to make the tool call for the LLM.

There's no guarantee the LLM will find your tool correctly â€” it's a neural network trained to detect tool use, not a guaranteed execution engine.

I learned this lesson building enterprise chatbots. The breakthrough came when I realized that tools work brilliantly for chat-based applications (where you can't control the order of operations), but they're terrible for structured workflows that need specific sequences. For those, you're better off calling databases yourself and feeding structured data to the LLM.

Want to know when tools are your secret weapon versus when they'll sabotage your application?

Read Chapter 6 to discover the practical strategies for building LLM tools that actually workâ€”from prompt-based functions to enterprise-grade plugins, plus the critical patterns that separate reliable tool implementations from debugging nightmares.
