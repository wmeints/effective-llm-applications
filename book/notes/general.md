## Topics to cover

- Introduction to working with an LLM, what is it, and why is it so powerful?
- Introduction to semantic kernel
- Writing basic prompts
- Generating structured output
- Augmenting LLMs with tools
- Retrieval augmented generation
- Routing requests to specific agents
- Orchestrating the LLM with workers
- Building an agent workflow
- Building an artist/critic workflow
- Using multiple agents in a team

## Focus

- I want to show practical examples of each pattern that we discuss in the book.
- We should focus on the concepts rather than the tool semantic kernel. You can use other tools as well, but I feel that Semantic Kernel is the best right now.
- I want to be able to take pieces from the book and turn them into course material later on, so each chapter should be readable on its own.

## Structure of the book

- I want the book to have a preface in which I cover the structure of the book, the main topics, and the goal of the book. We should also mention the target audience.
- After the preface we should add the remaining chapters of the book. 
- Each chapter should have an introduction, the main content, and end with a summary of the chapter. We should also point to useful resources at the end of the chapter.
