If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.\n\n2. **Prepare the Dough**:\n   - Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface. Aim for your desired thickness (thin crust or thicker crust).\n   - Transfer the dough to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a preheated pizza stone.\n\n3. **Saut\u00E9 the Spinach (Optional)**:\n   - Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat.\n   - Add the minced garlic and saut\u00E9 for about 30 seconds until fragrant.\n   - Toss in the spinach, season with a pinch of salt and pepper, and cook until just wilted (1-2 minutes).
