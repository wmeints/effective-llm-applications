    "Question": "How does a vector database store content in a usable format?",
    "Answer": "A vector database stores content in a usable format by translating the content into **embedding vectors** that represent the semantic meaning of the content. These embedding vectors are generated using an embedding model, such as OpenAI\u0027s \u0060text-embedding-v3-small\u0060. Each embedding vector is a numerical representation of the text, with dimensions determined by the embedding model (e.g., 1536 dimensions for the mentioned model).\n\nOnce the embedding vector is created, it is stored in the vector database along with the original content and metadata. During retrieval, the vector database compares the embedding vector of a query (created using the same embedding model) with the stored embedding vectors. The database uses **cosine similarity** to measure how closely the query vector aligns with the stored vectors, allowing it to return the most semantically similar content.\n\nThis method is robust because it enables the system to handle spelling mistakes, synonyms, or different phrasing while still finding relevant content.",

    "Question": "What testing approach does this code use for varying input?",
    "Answer": "The testing approach used in the code for varying input is **data-driven testing**. This is evident from the use of the \u0060[Theory]\u0060 attribute and \u0060[InlineData(...)]\u0060 in the test method. Data-driven testing allows you to run the same test logic with different input samples, enabling you to validate the behavior of the application across a variety of scenarios.\n\nFor example, in the test method \u0060TestGenerateRecipe_ContainsInstructions\u0060, the test is executed for each set of input data provided via \u0060[InlineData(\u0022pizza\u0022, new string[] { \u0022spinach\u0022, \u0022mozzarella\u0022 })]\u0060.

Using CSV files simplifies managing and aggregating these samples.\n\n4. **Structured Data Storage**: CSV files provide a structured format to store inputs, expected outputs, and other metadata (e.g., test case names, categories, or metrics). This organization makes it easier to analyze and refine test cases.\n\n5. **Ease of Integration**: CSV files can be easily integrated into automated testing pipelines or frameworks. They allow for straightforward data ingestion and processing with programming languages or testing tools.\n\n6. **Coverage and Diversity**: By curating diverse samples in a CSV file, you can ensure that your test set covers a wide range of inputs, edge cases, and potential failure points, which helps evaluate the robustness of your LLM-based application.\n\n7. **Facilitates Iterative Improvement**: Collecting and storing test results alongside inputs in CSV files can help identify patterns in failures, enabling iterative improvements to prompts, model configurations, or application logic.\n\n8. **Collaborative Testing**: CSV files are easy to share among team members or stakeholders, allowing for collaborative development and review of test cases.\n\nOverall, using CSV files as a source for testing LLM outputs provides a practical, organized, and scalable way to validate the application\u0027s performance and identify areas for improvement.",

    "Question": "What is the context window in LLMs?",
    "Answer": "The context window in LLMs refers to the amount of text (input and output) that a model can consider at once. It acts as the model\u0027s \u0022short-term memory.\u0022 The size of the context window varies depending on the model, and it determines how much text can be processed in a single interaction.\n\nModern commercial models typically support larger context windows, with ranges around **100K-250K input tokens** and approximately **4K output tokens**, which translates to roughly 100K words on average (equivalent to the size of a full book). Open-source models generally have smaller context windows due to limitations in the number of parameters in their neural networks.\n\nEffectively managing the context window is crucial when building LLM-based applications, as exceeding the window\u0027s limits can lead to truncated inputs or outputs.",

    "Question": "What is a prompt-based kernel function?",
    "Answer": "A **prompt-based kernel function** in Semantic Kernel is a reusable C# function that is created from a prompt template. The purpose of these kernel functions is to encapsulate the logic of the prompt into a callable programmatic function, making it easier to reuse, version, and integrate into your application. \n\nInstead of invoking a prompt directly, you can compile it into a kernel function, store it in your program logic, and use it repeatedly across different parts of your application. \n\nHere are the key steps to create a prompt-based kernel function:\n\n1. **Load the Prompt Template**: The prompt is typically written in a file (e.g., \u0060prompt.txt\u0060) and loaded into the program.\n2. **Set Execution Settings**: Specify parameters like \u0060MaxTokens\u0060, \u0060Temperature\u0060, and others that control the behavior of the LLM.\n3. **Compile the Prompt into a Kernel Function**: Use the \u0060CreateFunctionFromPrompt\u0060 method to turn the prompt into a kernel function. This step includes defining the template, choosing a templating language (e.g., Handlebars, Semantic Kernel Templates, YAML), and passing the execution settings.\n4. **Invoke the Kernel Function**: Use the \u0060InvokeAsync\u0060 method to execute the function, passing the required arguments.\n\n### Example Code\nThe following example demonstrates creating and invoking a kernel function from a prompt:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060csharp\nvar promptTemplate = File.ReadAllText(\n    Path.Join(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), \u0022prompt.txt\u0022)\n);\n\nvar executionSettings = new AzureOpenAIPromptExecutionSettings\n{\n    MaxTokens = 1200,\n    Temperature = 0.5,\n    TopP = 1.0,\n    FrequencyPenalty = 0.0,\n    PresencePenalty = 0.0\n};\n\nvar prompt = kernel.CreateFunctionFromPrompt(\n    promptTemplate, templateFormat: \u0022handlebars\u0022,\n    promptTemplateFactory: new HandlebarsPromptTemplateFactory(),\n    executionSettings: executionSettings);\n\nvar result = await kernel.InvokeAsync(prompt, new KernelArguments\n{\n\u00A0 \u00A0 [\u0022dish\u0022] = \u0022pizza\u0022,\n\u00A0 \u00A0 [\u0022ingredients\u0022] = new List\u003Cstring\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 {\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u0022pepperoni\u0022,\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u0022mozzarella\u0022,\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u0022spinach\u0022\n\u00A0 \u00A0 }\n});\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n### Benefits of Prompt-Based Kernel Functions\n- **Reusability**: Prompts are compiled into functions that can be reused across different parts of your application.\n- **Version Control**: Prompt templates can be stored in source control for easy versioning.\n- **Encapsulation**: Business logic becomes more readable and maintainable by encapsulating prompts into functions.\n- **Flexibility**: These functions allow you to integrate dynamic arguments and execution settings easily.\n\nIn summary, a prompt-based kernel function is a way to turn a prompt into a reusable, maintainable, and callable function in your application logic, enhancing the scalability and manageability of LLM-based workflows.",
