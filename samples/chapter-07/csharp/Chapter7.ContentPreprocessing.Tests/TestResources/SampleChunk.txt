multi-agent teams, exploring how to coordinate multiple AI agents working together
  with defined roles, communication protocols, and strategies for solving complex tasks.
  Although the multi-agent pattern is still in its infancy, reading this chapter will
  help you understand where current generative AI research is moving towards.

## System requirements

This book contains samples in C# to demonstrate various patterns. Please make sure you
have the following tools available on your system:

- [.NET SDK 9.0 or Higher](https://dot.net/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or a similar containerization tool.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or a similar code editing tool.
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) for working with Azure OpenAI.

## Running the sample code in this book

This book comes with samples on GitHub. You can find the repository at
[https://github.com/wmeints/effective-llm-applications/](https://github.com/wmeints/effective-llm-applications/).
You'll find the samples in the `samples` folder in the repository.

Each sample comes with a README.md file that explains how to run the sample and the
requirements for the sample. I've made sure you can run the sample with either Azure
OpenAI or the regular OpenAI service when you follow the instrucitons in the included
README.md file.

As an added bonus, I've made sure to include samples for Java and Python too. So if you
are reading this book but don't work with C#, you can still try out the samples.

## Feedback and issues

repository][BOOK_REPO]. I'll do my best to address the issue as soon as possible.
