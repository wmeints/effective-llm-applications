  We’re writing a blog post about "{{topic}}". The main goal of the blog post is to explain the
  importance of securing your agent properly. Please use the following step-by-step instructions to write the article:
  
  1.	First, research the topic by looking at 5 articles on the internet using the `search` tool that I’ve provided.
  2.	Next, create an outline based on the research you found. We should only cover the top-level headings in the outline, we’ll expand these headings later.
  3.	After creating the outline, go over each section and figure out a key talking point for that section.
  4.	Finally, expand each section covering the key talking point.
  
  Write the article. Make sure to include the title of the article.
