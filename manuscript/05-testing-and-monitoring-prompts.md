A> **Coming soon**\
A> I've not yet written this portion of this chapter yet because I'm debating whether
A> I should include an internal tool that we're working on. The tool is not offered as
A> open-source at the moment, but I think it can be very helpful to speed up the process
A> of testing your prompts. On the other hand, I strongly believe that this book
A> shouldn't force you to use a tool that we offer through my employer. I want this to
A> be useful regardless of whether you're using my testing tool or regular unit-testing
A> tools. To be continued...
