# Understanding Large Language Models

I remember the first time I realized just how useful large language models could
be. Like many developers, I initially tried ChatGPT almost as a joke – I didn't expect
it to work as well as it did. I had this piece of code that needed unit tests, and on a
whim, I copy-pasted it into ChatGPT and asked it to write the tests for me. What
happened next surprised me. Within seconds, I got back working code that needed only
minor tweaks. The overall structure was spot-on, and it saved me 30 minutes of work.
While 30 minutes doesn't sound like a lot of time saved, it does add up and this is
the worst-case scenario at a time when I didn't quite understand how an LLM worked.

Here's the thing – that interaction looked like magic, but really wasn't. It was the
result of careful engineering, good quality prompt design, and an understanding of what
LLMs can (and can't) do well. That's what this chapter is all about: demystifying these
powerful tools so you can put them to work in your own applications.

You've probably heard the buzz around LLMs. Maybe you've played with ChatGPT, Claude,
or other AI assistants. Maybe you're skeptical about the hype, or maybe you're excited
about the possibilities. Whatever your starting point, this chapter will give you the
solid foundation you need to move beyond simple interactions and start building real
applications with LLMs.

We'll start with the basics – what LLMs are and why they matter – but we won't get
bogged down in the theoretical. Instead, we'll focus on the practical: how these models
work in the real world, what they're good at, and where they fall short. I'll share
stories from my own journey with LLMs, including the failures and breakthroughs that
taught me the most.

By the end of this chapter, you'll understand:

- The key concepts and terminology you need to work effectively with LLMs
- How to evaluate different models and choose the right one for your needs
- Practical considerations for building production applications
- Real-world use cases and applications that go beyond the obvious

Let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of large language models – not as
magical black boxes, but as practical tools we can understand, control, and use to
solve real problems.

One quick note before we begin: throughout this chapter, I'll be sharing code examples
and practical tips based on my experience. While the specific models and APIs might
evolve, the underlying principles and patterns will remain relevant. I encourage you to
run the examples yourself and experiment with different approaches. That's how you'll
truly internalize these concepts and make them your own.

## What are LLMs and why they matter

Let's start with the basics. A Large Language Model (LLM) is a neural network trained on
massive amounts of data to understand and generate human-like text.

### A brief history

Language models aren't new at all. We've been trying to understand human language for
a very long time. Early attempts involved pattern matching using regular expressions.
Probably well-known for the fact that you only write them once and then never change
them because they're hard to understand and quite inflexible.

Later we introduced clunky chatbots that were capable of matching patterns to understand
intent using machine learning. These bots still had fixed responses and were unable to
understand intent when the input was even slightly off.

The real game-changers started appearing around 2017. Before that we had language models
that were rather specialized and limited in performance. Don't get me wrong, tools like
[SpaCy](https://spacy.io/) were amazing at the time for what we could do.

### The breakthrough moment

Everything changed with the introduction of the transformer neural network architecture.
The paper ["Attention is all you need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) demonstrated
a completely new way of processing language. I won't bore you with the technical
details, but here is why it matters: Previous models would process text word-by-word
and weren't able to look at the context as a whole. The transformer architecture instead
looks at the entire context at once, understanding the relationship between words
regardless of their position.

Think about how you understand this sentence: "The developer copy-pasted the code into
ChatGPT to generate unit-tests for it.". You automatically know "it" refers to the code,
not the tool ChatGPT. Transformers can make these connections too, and they can do it at
scale.

### How LLMs Work

At their core, LLMs predict what comes next based on what they've seen before. When you
give an LLM a prompt, it's not searching through a database for answers. Instead, it's
using its understanding of patterns to generate responses word by word.

Here's a simplified view of what happens:

1. Your input gets broken down into tokens (pieces of words or characters)
2. The model looks at these tokens and their relationships using attention mechanisms
3. It predicts the most likely next token based on its training
4. This process repeats until it generates a complete response

The magic happens in how these models handle context. The attention mechanism helps
predict the combined context of input and (the to be generated) output. When you feed
tokens into the model, the attention mechanism state is updated with the current
understanding of the context that we're working on. Based on this information the model
can now more reliably predict the next likely token.

### Why This Matters for Software Development

You might be thinking, "Okay, cool technology, but why should I care as a developer?"
Here's why:

First, LLMs are changing how we write code. They're not just glorified autocomplete –
they can understand intent. When I'm working on a new feature, I can describe what I
want in plain English, and an LLM can help me scaffold the code, suggest test cases,
or point out potential issues.

So even if you're not building AI applications yourself, it will change how your tools work
and how quickly and effectively you can write code.

Second, and this is what this book is about, they're enabling new types of applications.
Think about all the tasks that were too complex or expensive to automate before because
they required understanding natural language. Now we can build applications that can:

- Generate human-like responses to customer inquiries
- Upgrade code bases from deprecated frameworks or old languages to more modern equivalents
- Translate raw input from field reports into a coherent and actionable management summary
- Help review a document that you wrote by providing useful suggestions to improve it

And we're just getting started!

### The Current Reality

Let's be clear though – LLMs aren't magic. They have real limitations. They can provide
you with some pretty surprising responses, the response can look right but contain
the wrong information, and you need to apply careful engineering to use LLMs in
production systems.

That's exactly why understanding how they work is so crucial. When you know what's
happening under the hood, you can:

- Design better prompts that get more reliable results
- Build safeguards against common failure modes
- Create hybrid systems that combine LLM capabilities with traditional programming
- Make informed decisions about when (and when not) to use LLMs

In the next sections, we'll dive deeper into these practical aspects. But first, let me
share some real examples from my own journey with LLMs – including the mistakes I made
so you don't have to repeat them.

## My journey with LLMs

My journey with LLMs started with a healthy dose of "this isn't going to work". Like
many of you didn't quite understand the impact of this new technology.

That unit testing experiment changed everything. Not because the code was perfect
(it wasn't), but because it showed me that LLMs could understand context and generate
meaningful output that was actually useful. This wasn't just pattern matching or
template filling – it was something qualitatively different.

### Early experiments

Of course, once I saw what LLMs could do I went a little overboard with ChatGPT. I tried
to use it for everything text related. I even messed up two blog posts on my website
with the negative feedback to show for it. It turns out, LLMs produce flavorless and
pretty mediocre content. They were trained to represent the average of what language
has to offer. And that's, well, pretty average and flavourless.

I tried using LLMs for coding too, as I am a developer. I wrote a full application using
only AI. And it's used in production today. But it was quite hard to get there. The LLM
quite frequently steered into the wall with weird layouts and useless unit-tests. I
haven't bothered measuring how quickly I built the application. But I have a feeling
that I was quicker, but I was also less satisfied with the result, because I feel that
writing code is a skill I'm proud of.

After learning about open source models I figured I should give that a try too. It
turned out to be very slow even on a beefy Intel Core i9 machine with a huge graphics
card. I quickly found out that you need an aweful lot of power to run an LLM on our
own machine and in the cloud.

There are plenty more experiences where I found the boundaries of what LLMs can do, but
let me finish with one final example. I tried using an LLM to upgrade program code from
a low-code solution to Typescript without human supervision. We quickly had to put in
human supervision, because the results were horrible!

### Key lessons learned

You might wonder, why am I telling you my experiences? There are three key lessons that
I want you to keep in mind while reading this book:

1. Be specific in what you ask from the LLM. Don't just ask for an article about LLMs,
   provide specific instructions.

2. Always review and understand the output of the LLM. Don't let your users use the output
   of the LLM unseen. The output will be wrong in all the weird ways you've never thought of.

3. Break big problems down into small problems. Instead of asking the LLM to perform
   10 steps, ask it for just one step. It will be easier for the LLM to perform and
   easier for you to debug.

4. Keep track of the context yourself and provide it in focused chunks. LLMs have
   limited input and output space, so they can't keep track of a complete book or
   even a blog post.

### Evolution of my understanding

After the initial rollercoaster ride with LLMs my understanding of them evolved. I stopped
seeing them as a silver bullet that can solve all my language related problems and started
seeing them as a powerful pattern-matching engine capable of transforming text.

One breakthrough moment was realizing that LLMs excel at clearly defined tasks that involve
matching a pattern in source text and transforming it into other text. If you can find a clear
pattern in the input yourself, and you can clearly define the target structure, it's
likely that an LLM is a good solution to your problem. The less clear the problem statement
is, the more issues you'll experience.

If you want to build an effective LLM application you'll want to provide a good balance
between human and machine. Human oversight is essential when using an LLM. Throughout
the rest of the book you will find that I'm using interaction patterns that promote
human oversight, because it's necessary and improves the experience by a lot.

### How I integrated LLMs into real projects

Clearly defined problems and human oversight are important when you view an LLM-based
application from a functional perspective. From a technical perspective, it's important
that you think about applying LLMs as a software engineering problem with an AI aspect
rather than a pure AI project.

Here are three reasons why you should use a software engineering approach:

- LLMs will behave better when you follow a structured approach. The more structure, the better.
- LLM behavior changes when providers push new versions of the models, automated testing is your friend.
- LLMs are slow, you will need to find ways to provide delayed responses to the user.
- The API endpoints of LLM providers often break, so you'll need to have solid error handling.

Throughout the rest of the book, I will share the strategies that I applied to help me get
the most out of my LLM-based applications.

### Moving forward

These experiences shaped how I approach LLM integration today. Instead of asking
"Can an LLM do this?", I ask "How can an LLM help with this specific aspect of the
problem?" This shift in perspective has been crucial for building practical,
reliable systems.

In the next section, we'll look at the current LLM landscape and how you can choose the
right models for your projects. We'll build on these lessons learned to help you make
informed decisions about which LLMs to use and how to use them effectively.

## The current LLM landscape

After sharing my journey, let's look at the tools available to you right now. The LLM
landscape is incredibly dynamic, with new models and capabilities being developed
frequently. I'll focus on what's practically useful for building applications.

### Overview of major LLM providers

It's good to know that the most powerful models right now are made available by a few
major LLM providers. There are open source options too, but these are generally less
powerful and require more engineering effort to use. Having said that, I highly recommend
you give them a try, because they offer other benefits you can't get from major LLM providers.

#### OpenAI

They've been at the forefront with their GPT series. What I love about OpenAI is their
API's reliability. The downside? They can be expensive for large-scale applications,
and their terms of service are quite restrictive. Also, it takes a while before newer
models become available through the API. And if they become available, it takes a while
before you can push a decent amount of tokens through the API, because the rate limits
are pretty low.

#### Anthropic

Their Claude model has impressed me with its ability to handle complex instructions and
longer context windows. I've found it particularly good at tasks requiring careful
reasoning, like code review and technical writing. The pricing is competitive
with OpenAI, and their terms of service are generally more business-friendly.

Anthropic is notorious for their rate limits. They often cap out and you'll end up with
random overload errors. It's important to have a good contract with them or plan for
a backup.

Sadly though, you can't use Anthropic directly with Semantic Kernel at this time, so
you'll not find much about the models from Anthropic in this book.

#### Meta

With LLaMA and its variants, Meta has shaken up the field by releasing powerful
open-source models. While you'll need more technical expertise to use these effectively,
they offer flexibility that proprietary models can't match.

LLaMA models are available through the major cloud providers, but you can also run them
on your own machine if you have a good enough GPU, for example a RTX4080 has no problem
running these models. If you want to give this a try, I recommend taking a look at
[Ollama](https://ollama.com/).

#### Google

Their PaLM API and Gemini models are interesting contenders that I personally haven't
had much experience with. However, if you're in the Google space, then they are a great
option and relatively easy to configure these days. I've found their documentation
particularly developer-friendly.

### Model comparison

Let's break down the model types that I've worked with to give you an understanding
of what to expect from each model type.

#### GPT series by OpenAI

- **GPT-4o:** The king of the hill when it comes to the GPT models. This model is powerful
  enough for most complex tasks. It's a general purpose model, useful for code as well
  as more generic text based tasks. This model supports generating images too.

- **GPT-4o mini:** The smaller brother of the GPT-4o model is a lot faster while still
  providing plenty of capabilities. I generally try this model first and only switch
  to the bigger and slower GPT-4o model when tests fail too frequently.

Recently, OpenAI started work on a new series of models called the Orion models. These
models focus on reasoning capabilties, and generally lack the general purpose features
that the GPT series has. Currently, there are two Orion-type models:

- **o1:** This is the biggest model so far from OpenAI. It's at the top of the
  benchmarks right now for biology, physics, and chemistry tasks. However, you're paying
  a premium for something that you can solve using the patterns in this book in combination
  with a less expensive model. Proceed with caution.

- **o1-mini:** Is the smaller version with capabilities somewhere between GPT-4o and o1.
  This model lacks a lot of the general knowledge included in GTP-4o and o1, so it will
  be useful for specific reasoning tasks but not much else.

You can find a full listing of the OpenAI models on [their website][OPENAI_MODELS].

#### Claude models by Anthropic

Claude models come in three varieties, just as with the GPT series, you can choose a smaller,
less capable, but faster and cheaper model depending on what your use-case is.

- **Haiku:** The fastest model from Anthropic. It lacks the capability to process
  images, but otherwise this model provides a very fast response with good quality
  reasoning capabilities.

- **Sonnet:** This is the GPT-4o equivalent from Anthropic. It's most useful for writing
  code and long form content. My personal experience with it that it is quite good at
  following more complex instructions, and it will stick to your style instructions
  quite well.

- **Opus:** This is the bigger brother of the Sonnet model. At the time of writing it
  hasn't been updated since 2023, and I expect it will be a while before they update it.
  It is slightly stronger than Sonnet at complex reasoning tasks.

As with the OpenAI models, I recommend testing your prompts and going with the cheaper
model first before attempting the same task with a bigger model. I've found that the
Sonnet model is overall your best option right now.

#### LLaMA and open-source alternatives

There are many open-source options available at the moment, and it is hard to keep up
with all the development progress. I've found that overall the commercial offerings
provide a great all round experience. I generally start with the commercial models when
I'm exploring a use case. When I understand a use case well enough, I will give an
open-source model a try to see whether we can lower the price point of our solution.

Having said that, I've had great experiences with these models:

- **LLaMA 3.3:** A general purpose model offered by Meta through [Hugging
  Face][HUGGINGFACE_LLAMA]. This model comes in two types, a pretrained variant that you
  can fine-tune yourself to perform specific tasks, and an instruction tuned model that
  Meta recommend to use for chat applications. But don't let yourself be limited by what
  Meta says, because the instruction tuned version is quite useful for non-chat purposes
  as well, as long as you have an instruction based use case.

- **Mistral:** The Mistral model by the identically named company is a very fast
  open-source LLM that is mostly used for chat purposes. This model is generally less
  capable than the LLaMA model variants, but its speed makes up for that. This model is
  also hosted on [HuggingFace][HUGGINGFACE_MISTRAL] and comes in many fine-tuned
  variants.

- **Gemma2:** was published by Google in February 2024 and is trained using a
  [teacher/student technique][HUGGINGFACE_GEMMA2]. The training
  technique itself looks very interesting, but I've found that Gemma2 isn't quite as
  good for many of the tasks that I worked on as the other models in the open-source
  space.

- **Phi 4:** Is a new model that was [introduced by Microsoft in december
  2024][PHI4_ANNOUNCEMENT]. It has a similar size compared to the Mistral and Gemma2
  models, 14 billion parameters but shows higher performance in [the
  benchmarks][PHI4_BENCHMARKS]. While this doesn't tell the whole story, I think it's
  worth trying this model when you are looking for a smaller open-source model.

### Making practical choices

It's important to remember that the most powerful model isn't always the best option. I
follow this general workflow when developing an LLM-based application that can be quite
helpful if you're just starting out:

1. First, I choose a general purpose model based on the cloud provider I'm working with.
   Most of the time my clients already have a contract with either Microsoft Azure or
   AWS to host their solutions. I use the existing environment to prototype the
   solution.

2. After the initial prototype, I'll look at data privacy requirements and intellectual
   property issues that the solution may have. Depending on these requirements I will
   determine the engineering effort and contractual effort we need to undertake to make
   the solution production viable. Usually, I'm the person who talks about the technical
   requirements while one of our legal people looks into contracts.

3. After the initial prototype and requirements gathering, we'll deploy the solution to
   production for a smaller group of people to gather initial user feedback and monitor
   for performance and costs. Based on this information I decide whether we should go
   back and optimize the solution or replace the model with something else.

4. Once the solution is optimized and running in production for the general population
   of an organization, I'll keep monitoring in production for sudden changes in quality
   of the responses or performance. We regularly test and update the models to improve
   the overall performance of the solution.

This general workflow has helped me quite well over the past few years to deploy
solutions in production. In the next section we'll dive into key concepts and
terminology to use LLMs effectively. Understanding these fundamentals will help you make
better decisions during the development process of your LLM-based applications.

## Key Concepts and Terminology

Before we dive into building applications with LLMs, let's cover some essential concepts
you'll need to understand. Don't worry if some of these seem abstract at first – we'll
put them into practice throughout the rest of the book.

### Essential Terminology

#### Tokens and Tokenization

Before an LLM can process your text, it needs to break it down into tokens. Think of
tokens as the building blocks the model uses to understand text. A token can be:

- A complete word
- Part of a word
- A number
- A special character
- A delimiter

The process works like this: your text gets split into tokens, which are then converted
into numbers using the model's vocabulary. This conversion is necessary because the
transformer-based neural network that powers the LLM can only process numbers, not raw
text.

For example, the word "tokenization" might be split like this:

```plaintext
"tokenization" -> ["token", "ization"]
```

When the model generates a response, the process happens in reverse – tokens are
converted back into text. This is why sometimes you might see slightly odd word splits
in responses, especially with technical terms or rare words.

#### Embedding Models

At the input side of almost all LLMs is something called an embedding layer. This
component turns tokens into dense vectors that capture the semantic meaning of the text.
It's interesting because it can represent the relationships between words in a
mathematical space.

The embedding layer isn't just a random part of the model – it's trained on vast amounts
of text to understand how words relate to each other based on their context. Think of it
as a map where similar words or concepts are located close to each other.

You'll work directly with embeddings later when we implement the Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) pattern in Chapter 5. For now, just know that they're important for how
LLMs understand text.

#### Context Window

Every LLM has a limit to how much text it can consider at once – this is called the
context window. It's essentially the model's short-term memory, including both your
input and its output.

Context windows have grown significantly:

- Most modern commercial models handle 100K-250K tokens
- This translates to roughly 100K words on average
- Open source models typically have smaller windows due to their compact size

You can find the exact size in the model's documentation (often called a model card).
Managing this context window effectively becomes crucial when building applications, as
we'll see in later chapters.

#### Output Sampling and Temperature

LLMs aim to produce human-like text, and one way they do this is through output
sampling. When generating each token, the model doesn't just pick the most likely
option, it samples from a distribution of possibilities.

Temperature is your main control over this sampling process:

- Low temperature (0.1-0.3): More focused, deterministic responses
- High temperature (0.7-0.9): More creative, varied output

Here's how I typically set temperature:

- Code generation: 0.2 (we want precision)
- Content creation: 0.7 (we want creativity)
- Factual responses: 0.1 (we want consistency)

While temperature is the most common setting you'll adjust, there are other sampling
parameters available. I recommend checking out [this article][PARAMETER_EXPLANATION] for
a deeper dive into all the options.

#### Few-shot Learning

Sometimes the best way to get what you want from an LLM is to show it examples. This is
called few-shot learning, and it comes in two flavors:

**One-shot Learning**  
You provide a single example:

```plaintext
Input: "The pizza was cold"
Output: Negative sentiment

Now classify: "The service was excellent"
```

**Few-shot Learning**  
You provide multiple examples:

```plaintext
Input: "The pizza was cold"
Output: Negative sentiment

Input: "The atmosphere was lovely"
Output: Positive sentiment

Now classify: "The service was excellent"
```

Often, one good example is enough, but complex tasks might need more.

#### Zero-shot Capabilities

Modern LLMs are so well-trained that they can often perform tasks without any examples.
This is called zero-shot learning. You just describe what you want:

```plaintext
Classify the sentiment of this review: "The service was excellent"
```

While I often start with zero-shot for simplicity, I'm not afraid to add examples if the
results aren't quite what I need. The key is being flexible and pragmatic about which
approach you use.

In the next section, we'll look at core concepts for working with these
models.

### Core Concepts

#### Prompt Engineering

The input you give to an LLM is called a prompt. Think of it as instructions that tell
the model what you want it to do. A prompt contains both the task description and any
context the model needs to generate the right output.

Here's a simple example:

```plaintext
Bad prompt:
"Write a function that validates email addresses."

Good prompt:
"Write a C# function that validates email addresses. The function should:

- Use regular expressions for validation
- Return a boolean indicating if the email is valid
- Handle common edge cases like missing @ symbols"
```

You'll find many websites promoting "proven" prompt patterns, often with claims like:

- "Always start with 'You are an expert...'"
- "Use this exact format for best results..."
- "Include these specific phrases..."

I've learned the hard way that while these patterns might work initially, they often
break in unexpected ways. What works better is:

- Testing your prompts thoroughly
- Adjusting temperature and other parameters
- Building robust error handling around the LLM
- Iterating based on real usage

We'll dive deep into practical prompt engineering in Chapter 3.

#### Fine-tuning vs. Prompt Engineering

You might hear people talk about fine-tuning models for specific domains. Let me share
my perspective on this.

Fine-tuning means taking a base model (like GPT-4) and training it further on your
specific data to make it better at particular tasks. While this sounds appealing, there
are several reasons I rarely recommend it:

**Why People Consider Fine-tuning:**

- Make the model more specialized for specific tasks
- Improve performance for domain-specific language
- Ensure consistent outputs

**Why I Usually Avoid It:**

1. Cost
   - Significant computing resources required
   - High monetary investment
   - Ongoing maintenance costs

2. Complexity
   - Requires extensive training data
   - Technical expertise needed
   - Time-consuming process

3. Trade-offs
   - Lose general capabilities
   - Limited flexibility
   - Can be overkill for most use cases

Instead of fine-tuning, I typically recommend alternatives like Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG). Here's a practical example:

Let's say you're building a chatbot to answer questions about your company's products.
Instead of fine-tuning a model on your product documentation, you could:

1. Store your documentation in a vector database
2. Search for relevant information when a question comes in
3. Include that information in your prompt as context
4. Let the LLM generate an answer based on the provided context

This approach is:

- More flexible (easy to update documentation)
- Cost-effective (no training required)
- Faster to implement
- More maintainable

Throughout this book, we'll explore patterns like RAG that give you the control you need
without the complexity of fine-tuning. In Chapter 5, we'll implement a complete RAG
system so you can see these benefits firsthand.

In the next section, we'll look at practical considerations for working with these
models, building on these fundamental concepts to create reliable applications.

## Practical Considerations for Working with LLMs

Now that we understand the key concepts, let's talk about the practical aspects of
working with LLMs. These are lessons I've learned the hard way, and they'll help you
avoid some common pitfalls.

### Cost Management Strategies

Cost management is crucial when building LLM-based applications. I've seen costs grow
exponentially in complex applications, so here's what I've learned:

When starting with LLMs, I strongly recommend beginning with cloud solutions rather than
setting up your own infrastructure. Cloud providers offer a much lower initial cost
compared to purchasing on-premises hardware, and they give you the flexibility to scale
up or down as needed. This approach also makes it easier to experiment with different
models and configurations without making major infrastructure commitments.

Monitoring is a must for managing costs effectively. You'll want to get familiar with
your provider's monitoring dashboards and set up cost alerts before you start any
serious development. I recommend tracking usage patterns closely from day one – this
data will be invaluable when you need to optimize your application later.

When rolling out LLM-based applications I follow this approach:

1. Start with a limited user group
2. Monitor costs and usage patterns
3. Apply initial optimizations
4. Test with the small group again
5. Only then scale to full deployment

Always use the smallest model that can handle your task effectively. Anything you don't
need is just burning money.

### Rate Limiting and Quotas

When building an LLM-based application you'll quickly learn about rate limites. Every
cloud provider has them, and they each handle them a bit differently. Some, like Azure,
give you the flexibility to adjust your quotas, while others have fixed limits or offer
different tiers of access. Think of it as a traffic control system that helps ensure
fair resource distribution among all users.

When you first start hitting these limits, you might be tempted to request the highest
possible quotas for your applications. I've been there! If you're running multiple LLM
applications, maxing out quotas can lead to what we call "noisy neighbor" problems.
Imagine one hungry application consuming all your available quota, leaving your other
applications gasping for air. Pretty soon people will start calling you about their
failing application.

I recommend implementing a circuit breaker pattern in your production applications
whenever you call the LLM. It's like having a smart traffic controller that helps your
application gracefully handle situations when you're approaching or hitting these
limits. This pattern prevents cascading failures, manages quota exhaustion smoothly, and
keeps your application running even if at a reduced capacity. If you're interested in
implementing this pattern (which I highly recommend), check out this excellent guide
from Microsoft.

You can find a good implementation guide
[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker).

### API Reliability and Fallbacks

I've found significant differences in stability between providers. For example, Azure
has proven more stable than Anthropic in my experience. While many current LLM
applications don't have high availability requirements, I expect this to change soon.

Before you start building with LLMs, take some time to think about your availability
needs. In my experience, it's much easier to plan for these requirements upfront than to
retrofit them later. I recommend sitting down with your stakeholders to understand
exactly how critical the LLM functionality is to your application.

Having a fallback plan is also crucial. This might mean having arrangements with
multiple providers or maintaining simpler rule-based systems as backups. I've found that
even basic fallbacks can help maintain user trust when primary systems are unavailable.

When it comes to handling temporary hiccups, automatic retry logic is your friend. I
always implement exponential backoff in my applications when calling the LLM – it's like
having a polite conversation with an API. If it's busy, you wait a bit longer before
trying again, rather than constantly running down the door. This approach has saved many
of my applications from completely falling over during API instability.

Don't forget to keep an eye on your application's vital signs. Setting up monitoring for
response times and error rates will help you spot problems before they become critical.
I can't tell you how many times good monitoring has helped me identify issues before
users even noticed them.

### Security Considerations

While entire books could be written about LLM security, here are the essential aspects
you need to consider.

#### Data Privacy

This is often the first concern for my clients. Here's what you need to know:

- Provider policies vary and were often a little unclear about data privacy in the past
- Some providers may use conversations for model training

[The Samsung incident][SAMSUNG_INCIDENT] is a perfect example - their internal data was
exposed through ChatGPT when employees used it for work tasks. While providers now offer
better privacy controls, you should:

- Read provider agreements carefully
- Understand data usage policies
- Consider data residency requirements

Data privacy is, within reasonably limits, just another trade-off for you to consider.
It may be tempting to reach for on-premises right away, but they have their own problems
that are often worse than choosing the right LLM provider and setting up a good
agreement with them.

#### Prompt Injection

While LLMs' pattern-matching capabilities are impressive, they can also be a
double-edged sword. [This case study][PROMPT_INJECTION_CASE] shows how attackers can
manipulate LLMs to produce unintended responses.

From my experience building LLM-based applications, several strategies have proven
effective in protecting against these kinds of attacks. First, always start by clearly
defining and limiting what your LLM-based application can do. Think of it like the
principle of least privilege – give it access only to what it absolutely needs. Most
providers offer content filters out of the box, and I strongly recommend using them as
your first line of defense.

Input sanitization is also crucial. Just like you wouldn't trust user input in a
traditional web application, you need to be careful about what you feed into your LLM.
It's always a good option to add PII (Personal Identifiable Information) detection and
removal if you don't want your LLM to have access to personal data. There are many
ready-made solutions that can help.

I've found that implementing monitoring for suspicious patterns can help you catch
potential attacks early. This is especially critical when your LLM has connections to
internal systems – I've seen seemingly innocent prompts crafted to trick models into
revealing or doing things they shouldn't.

Remember that security is a continuous process, not a one-time setup. I regularly review
and update these protections as new attack patterns become popular.

#### Output Validation

Never trust raw LLM output, especially in web applications. Remember:

- LLMs can generate HTML and JavaScript
- Output needs sanitization before rendering
- Warn users about potential risks
- Implement content filtering
- Validate structured output against schemas

### Best Practices Summary

1. Start small and scale gradually
2. Monitor everything
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Use the minimum necessary model capabilities
5. Plan for failures
6. Take security seriously from day one

In the next chapters, we'll explore specific patterns and implementations that help
address these considerations. But keeping these practical aspects in mind will help you
build more reliable and cost-effective LLM applications from the start.
