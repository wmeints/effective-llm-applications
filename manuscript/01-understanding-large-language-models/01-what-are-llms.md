## What are LLMs and why they matter

Let's start with the basics. A Large Language Model (LLM) is a neural network trained on
massive amounts of data to understand and generate human-like text.

### A brief history

Language models aren't new at all. We've been trying to understand human language for
a very long time. Early attempts involved pattern matching using regular expressions.
Probably well-known for the fact that you only write them once and then never change
them because they're hard to understand and quite inflexible.

Later we introduced clunky chatbots that were capable of matching patterns to understand
intent using machine learning. These bots still had fixed responses and were unable to
understand intent when the input was even slightly off.

The real game-changers started appearing around 2017. Before that we had language models
that were rather specialized and limited in performance. Don't get me wrong, tools like
[SpaCy](https://spacy.io/) were amazing at the time for what we could do.

### The breakthrough moment

Everything changed with the introduction of the transformer neural network architecture.
The paper ["Attention is all you need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) demonstrated
a completely new way of processing language. I won't bore you with the technical
details, but here is why it matters: Previous models would process text word-by-word
and weren't able to look at the context as a whole. The transformer architecture instead
looks at the entire context at once, understanding the relationship between words
regardless of their position.

Think about how you understand this sentence: "The developer copy-pasted the code into
ChatGPT to generate unit-tests for it.". You automatically know "it" refers to the code,
not the tool ChatGPT. Transformers can make these connections too, and they can do it at
scale.

### How LLMs Work

At their core, LLMs predict what comes next based on what they've seen before. When you
give an LLM a prompt, it's not searching through a database for answers. Instead, it's
using its understanding of patterns to generate responses word by word.

Here's a simplified view of what happens:

1. Your input gets broken down into tokens (pieces of words or characters)
2. The model looks at these tokens and their relationships using attention mechanisms
3. It predicts the most likely next token based on its training
4. This process repeats until it generates a complete response

The magic happens in how these models handle context. The attention mechanism helps
predict the combined context of input and (the to be generated) output. When you feed
tokens into the model, the attention mechanism state is updated with the current
understanding of the context that we're working on. Based on this information the model
can now more reliably predict the next likely token.

### Why This Matters for Software Development

You might be thinking, "Okay, cool technology, but why should I care as a developer?"
Here's why:

First, LLMs are changing how we write code. They're not just glorified autocomplete –
they can understand intent. When I'm working on a new feature, I can describe what I
want in plain English, and an LLM can help me scaffold the code, suggest test cases,
or point out potential issues.

So even if you're not building AI applications yourself, it will change how your tools work
and how quickly and effectively you can write code.

Second, they're enabling new types of applications. Think about all the tasks that were
too complex or expensive to automate before because they required understanding natural
language. Now we can build applications that can:

- Generate human-like responses to customer inquiries
- Upgrade code bases from deprecated frameworks or old languages to more modern equivalents
- Translate raw input from field reports into a coherent and actionable management summary
- Help review a document that you wrote by providing useful suggestions to improve it

And we're just getting started!

### The Current Reality

Let's be clear though – LLMs aren't magic. They have real limitations and can make
mistakes. They can provide you with some pretty surprising responses, they can be
confidently wrong, and they need careful engineering to be useful in production systems.

That's exactly why understanding how they work is so crucial. When you know what's
happening under the hood, you can:

- Design better prompts that get more reliable results
- Build safeguards against common failure modes
- Create hybrid systems that combine LLM capabilities with traditional programming
- Make informed decisions about when (and when not) to use LLMs

In the next sections, we'll dive deeper into these practical aspects. But first, let me
share some real examples from my own journey with LLMs – including the mistakes I made
so you don't have to repeat them.
