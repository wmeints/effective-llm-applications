## My journey with LLMs

My journey with LLMs started with a healthy dose of "this isn't going to work". Like
many of you didn't quite understand the impact of this new technology.

That unit testing experiment changed everything. Not because the code was perfect
(it wasn't), but because it showed me that LLMs could understand context and generate
meaningful output that was actually useful. This wasn't just pattern matching or
template filling â€“ it was something qualitatively different.

### Early experiments

Of course, once I saw what LLMs could do I went a little overboard with ChatGPT. I tried
to use it for everything text related. I even messed up two blog posts on my website
with the negative feedback to show for it. It turns out, LLMs are pretty mediocre at
writing blog posts. They represent the average language. And that's, well, pretty
average.

I tried using LLMs for coding too, as I am a developer. I wrote a full application using
only AI. And it's used in production today. But it was quite hard to get there. The LLM
quite frequently steered into the wall with weird layouts and useless unit-tests. I
haven't bothered measuring how quickly I built the application. But I have a feeling
that I was quicker, but I was also less satisfied with the result, because I feel that
writing code is a skill I'm proud of.
