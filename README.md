# Building effective LLM-based applications with Semantic Kernel

Welcome to my new book about building effective LLM-based applications with Semantic
Kernel. This book is available on Leanpub soon! In the meantime, enjoy my little writing
corner on the web.

## Reading the book

As soon as the book is complete, you can read it on Leanpub. The link will be provided
here.

## Working with the examples

This book features useful examples that demonstrate how to implement various patterns
with Semantic Kernel. To use the examples you'll need:

- [.NET 9](https://dot.net/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Access to the OpenAI API or Azure OpenAI

You can open the solution in the `examples` directory to browse through them.
Follow the instructions provided with each example to run the example.

## Sponsor me

I am writing this in my spare time to help people gain practical knowledge about
working with large language models. The book is free, but I take donations as a token
of gratitude.
