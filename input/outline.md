# Building Intelligent Applications with LLMs

## Overview

This comprehensive guide explores the practical implementation of
Large Language Models(LLMs) in modern applications, with a focus on using Semantic
Kernel and related technologies. Through hands-on examples and real-world case studies,
readers will learn how to build, deploy, and maintain intelligent systems that leverage
the power of LLMs.
